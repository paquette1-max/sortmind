# File Organizer Test Data

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: ALL FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE TEST DATA ONLY

**All documents in this directory and its subdirectories are:**
- **NOT REAL** - Fictitious content generated for testing
- **FOR TESTING ONLY** - Do not use for any official purpose
- **SAFE** - Contains no real personal information

---

## Test Data Overview

This directory contains realistic-looking dummy documents that simulate the output of a **Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300** document scanner. These files are used to test and validate the File Organizer application.

### Document Types Included

| Category | Description | Count |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Bank Statements** | Statements from Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank, US Bank | 3+ files |
| **Medical Bills** | Hospital and clinic bills with procedures and charges | 3+ files |
| **Utility Bills** | Electric, gas, water, and internet/cable bills | 3+ files |
| **Tax Documents** | W-2 forms and 1099s | 3+ files |
| **Credit Card Statements** | Statements from major issuers | 3+ files |

## Usage

### Generating Test Data

To regenerate the test data with different random values:

```bash
cd /path/to/file_organizer/test_data
python3 generate_test_data.py --count 5
```

Options:
- `--count N` - Generate N files per document type (default: 5)
- `--output DIR` - Output directory (default: current directory)

### Running Tests

```bash
cd /path/to/file_organizer
pytest tests/test_with_scansnap_data.py -v
```

---

## Safety Verification

All test documents are automatically marked with:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ⚠️  THIS IS A TEST DOCUMENT - NOT REAL - FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️        ║
║  Generated by File Organizer Test Suite - DO NOT USE FOR ANY OFFICIAL PURPOSE ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

And a footer:
```
⚠️  FICTITIOUS DOCUMENT - GENERATED FOR SOFTWARE TESTING - NOT REAL ⚠️
Document ID: TEST-XXX | Generated: timestamp | Hash: XXXXXX
This document contains no real personal information or financial data.
```

## Testing Scenarios

The test data supports testing of:

1. **Document Classification** - Can the app identify document types?
2. **Date Extraction** - Can the app extract dates from various formats?
3. **Amount Parsing** - Can the app parse monetary values?
4. **Filename Suggestions** - Does the app suggest appropriate filenames?
5. **Organization Logic** - Does the app properly categorize and move files?
6. **Safety Features** - Does the app prevent data loss and handle errors?

---

## Security Considerations

- **Never delete this README** - It clearly marks all files as test data
- **Never move files out of test_data/** - Keep test data isolated
- **Never commit real documents here** - This directory is for test data only
- **Verify NOT REAL markers** - Always check generated files have proper markings

---

## Generated Data Characteristics

### Names
Generated names are combinations of common first and last names:
- Examples: "James Smith", "Mary Johnson", "John Williams"

### Addresses
Generated addresses use real street names from Arizona:
- Examples: "1234 Oak St, Phoenix, AZ 85001"

### Financial Data
All dollar amounts, account numbers, and SSNs are randomly generated:
- Account numbers: `****XXXX` format (last 4 digits vary)
- SSNs: `XXX-XX-XXXX` format (all random)
- Dollar amounts: Random values between reasonable ranges

### Company Names
Company names are fictional composites:
- Examples: "TechCorp Solutions", "Desert Dynamics"

## Maintenance

If you need to:
- **Add new document types**: Edit `generate_test_data.py`
- **Change randomization seed**: Modify the fake data generators
- **Update NOT REAL markers**: Edit `NOT_REAL_HEADER` and `NOT_REAL_FOOTER` in the generator
